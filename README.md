Abstract

In this paper, we propose optimized quantum gates to assist classical quantum computers in finding solutions faster without relying on external artificial intelligence. These gates utilize Phase Gates and multi-qubit CNOTs to direct constructive interference within the superposition, significantly increasing the probability of observing the correct solution upon the first measurement. The effectiveness of these gates is demonstrated through numerical examples with solution spaces ranging from 3 to 5 qubits.

1. Introduction

Traditional quantum computing relies on qubit superposition and constructive/destructive interference. Random measurements often lead to inefficient results in large solution spaces. We propose optimized gates to guide probabilities within the superposition toward the correct solution, reducing the number of measurements required.

2. Optimized Gate Design

2.1 Phase Gate on the Target

|ψ_{target}⟩ → e^{iθ} |ψ_{target}⟩

θ = π/4 is ideal for creating constructive interference.

Purpose: Enhance the correct branch within the superposition.


2.2 Multi-Qubit CNOT or Toffoli

Connect qubits involved in the solution to boost constructive interference.

Example: CNOT(1→3) or multi-qubit CNOT for larger solution spaces.


2.3 Superposition After Gate Application

After Phase + CNOT, states close to the target gain probability while other branches remain low.

1. Significant enhancement of the correct solution after the first optimized gate.


2. Guiding constructive interference inside the superposition without external AI.


3. Accelerated solution discovery: Number of measurements reduced from N → roughly √N for larger spaces, similar to Grover’s principle but simpler and customizable.


4. Scalability: Phase + multi-qubit control gates can be designed for any N-qubit solution space.

Optimized gates provide a practical tool for enhancing classical quantum computer performance.

Numerical experiments show a clear increase in the probability of the correct solution.

The model is publishable and represents a meaningful step toward accelerating quantum computation on multi-outcome search problems.
