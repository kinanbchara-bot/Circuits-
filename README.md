# Probabilistic Logic Circuits

A research and experimental project on **probabilistic logic circuits**, where entropy and measurement principles determine computational outcomes.  
The goal is to develop both a theoretical and practical framework for building logic gates that operate on probabilistic models, potentially enabling faster computation inspired by quantum systems.

## Components
- Theoretical model of probabilistic logic gates  
- Simplified mathematical equations for entropy and measurement  
- Solved examples and applications  
- Potential implementation on classical systems or quantum simulators

## How to Use
1. Review the theoretical model and equations provided.  
2. Apply the probabilistic gate definitions to design logic circuits.  
3. Simulate results using either a classical program (Python/Matlab) or a quantum simulator (Qiskit, Cirq).  
4. Compare multiple measurement outcomes to observe entropy-driven selection of solutions.
